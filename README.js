Talk Timer
==========

This project is a talk or speech timer. You set a maximum time in minutes, and optionally
choose a minimum time and a warning threshold time (both in minutes).

On start, the timer will start counting up. A bar grows from the bottom. On passing the
"minimum" time, it changes to green. On passing the "warning" time, it changes to
orange. On hitting the maximum time, it turns red.

The timer can be paused and resumed.
